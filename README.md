# Introduction ðŸŽ¶
Hello! Welcome to the MP4 to MP3 Converter! ðŸŽ‰

This program will take a video file that is in MP4 format and change it into an MP3 audio file. Itâ€™s like magic! You can use this to turn a video into music or sounds that you can listen to. ðŸŽµ

This program runs in something called Docker. Docker is like a mini computer inside your computer that has all the things the program needs to run. We'll go through how to set everything up and use the program!

# What You Need ðŸ’»
Docker: This is a tool that helps run our program. You can ask an adult to help you install Docker on your computer.

MP4 Video File: Find or make a video that you want to convert to audio. Save it into a folder called data in the same place where this program is.

A Little Patience: Sometimes computers can be slow or things don't work the first time. It's okay! Take a deep breath and know you're learning cool things!

# Steps To Convert Your Video ðŸ”§

## Step 1: Create Folders and Files
First, letâ€™s make sure we have all the files and folders in the right place. You should have a main folder (let's call it video-converter). Inside this folder, there should be:

A folder named data. Put your MP4 video in this folder.
A file named Dockerfile. This tells Docker how to set up the mini computer.
A file named docker-compose.yml. This tells Docker what to do.
A file named videotomusic.py. This is our magic spell, the program that converts the video to audio!
Your folders and files should look like this:

/Directory Structure/
video-converter/
|-- Dockerfile
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- videotomusic.py
|-- data/
|    |-- your-video.mp4  (put your video here!)

# Step 2: Setting Up Docker
Open your terminal or command prompt. It's like talking to the computer in its language! Go to the video-converter folder by typing:

bash
cd path/to/your/video-converter

Now, ask Docker to build the mini computer:

docker-compose build

# Step 3: Convert Your Video
Now, for the fun part! Type this 

command:

docker-compose run converter
This tells Docker to run our magic spell and convert the video. If all goes well, you will find an MP3 file in the data folder!

# Cleaning Up ðŸ§¹
You did it! Now, you can move your MP3 file to wherever you want, like your music folder.

One more thing! Sometimes we don't want certain types of files to get mixed with our code. We can tell the computer to ignore them. We do this with a file called .gitignore. In our case, it's set up to ignore MP4 and MP3 files so they stay in the data folder and don't get in the way.

Thanks for using the MP4 to MP3 Converter! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽµ
